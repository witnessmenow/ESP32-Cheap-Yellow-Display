# 3-LovyanGFX

This is adapted from the speed test sketch provided as an example in the TFT_eSPI library, which was itself adapted from the Adafruit speed test sketch. I have modified the code so it can be compiled with the LovyanGFX library.

The hard bit of using Lovyan is writing the header file for your board. The file I have included works with my CYD, which I think is pretty standard as CYDs go.

I find the Lovyan library is about 10% faster than TFT_eSPI.
